A Love Poem by Anonymous
 
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
My perfume is lovely,
And so are you.

Orchids are white,
Ghost ones are rare,
Marbles are shiny,
And so is your hair.

Magnolia grows,
With buds like eggs,
An ocean is beautiful,
And so are your legs.

Sunflowers reach,
Up to the skies,
My sun is dazzling,
And so are your eyes.

Foxgloves in hedges,
Surround the farms,
BPA-free water bottles are safe,
And so are your arms.

Daisies are pretty,
Daffies have style,
The moonlight is illuminating,
And so is your smile.

A is beautiful,
Just like you.
